WDNR staff are planning to provide technical expertise, implement the project and coordinate/oversee volunteer workdays through the completion of the project.", "TARGETSPECIES": "Brook trout", "TECHNIQUESSTRUCTURES": "Dam removal, fishability brushing, brush bundling, log sill installation", "DISPLAYNAME": "2018 North Branch Oconto River" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -88.648152332999985, 45.442123759056969 ] } },

Restore living space, and historical spawning areas.  Woody debris that has been covered with sediments rendering it useless will be replaced to the water, after removing for the dredging process, creating overhead habitat.  Open up the many natural spring upwelling's, creating better flow of colder water to the North Branch of the Oconto River.  Leaving 15-20% of the sediments will allow for repopulation of the benthic dweller's, and creating safe areas for young of the year (yoy) Brook Trout.", "TARGETSPECIES": "Brook Trout", "TECHNIQUESSTRUCTURES": null, "DISPLAYNAME": "2016 Hemlock Spring Pond" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -88.568093964999946, 45.369991643056906 ] } }
